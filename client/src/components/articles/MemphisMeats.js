                    <p>This company is trying to reduce farming related pollution and animal suffering through growing edible meat from cell form in a lab.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Uma Valeti is the CEO and co-founder of Memphis Meats who has been trained as a cardiologist who served in leadership roles at the American Heart Association and in the American College of Cardiology. At Memphis Meats, he guides the company’s vision and strategic direction.</p>
                    <p>Nicholas Genovese, PhD and Chief Science Officer, is globally known for his innovative cell-based meat. Before founding the company, he brought the vision of cell-based meat to the forefront of scientific disciplines, through communication and ground-breaking research.</p>
                    <p>Since being founded in 2015, the team was joined with a diverse group of scientists, engineers and designers who work to preserve human food traditions, while making meat more sustainable, healthy and delicious.</p>
                    <p>Located near San-Francisco in California, at the heart of silicon valley, the company’s work focuses on creating edible meat out of high quality cells, and cultivating them in a lab. This form of meat cultivation eliminates the need for animal rising and meat processing. If this industry becomes successful, it will reduce the amount of farming ground, and slaughterhouses required at the moment to supply meat demand.</p>
                    <p>The foundation of the company (2015) occurred at a time where finding solutions to polluting industries has become crucial. Memphis Meats is a sign of the desire to help reduce pollution, deforestation and the suffering of animals. With absolute control over the production of the meat from cell form, the company can insure their products will be cleaner and healthier than meat produced by farms.</p>
