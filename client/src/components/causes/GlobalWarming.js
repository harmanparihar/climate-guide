                <p>Climate change is a big and important topic nowadays, but somehow it doesnâ€™t receive the much deserved attention. In particular, global warming (these 2 terms are interchangeable but slightly different) is a real and serious issue that has become more intense and frequent in these last decades.</p>
                <p>Our planet is heating up too quickly, and it is largely due to human activity. The charts below are built with NASA, ICOS and NOAA databases, and are showing the levels of pollution created due to those activities.
